# Chess-Game-API

Developed a program that acts as a sort of “referee” for a simplified variant of chess by making sure that each player makes only valid moves, by tracking the history of the game, and by announcing a winner.

Each file uploaded contains the code for how each chess piece moves, and the GameApp file initiates the game using a chess canvas.
